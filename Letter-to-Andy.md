Andy,

I believe there is an important narrative waiting to be told. 20 years ago, your curated book on peer-to-peer changed my life. I've even had the pleasure of meeting folks like Dan Bricklin and Clay Shirky, but, more fundamentally, it changed how I looked at individuals' and small groups' ability to impact the direction of technology. It influenced my decision to make BeagleBoard which had a significant role in shifting embedded computing solutions, including the Raspberry Pi.

My vision of people having cheap, dedicated computers in their home where they could leverage a community of developers to host their own services and not be dependent on large external providers was not realized. The walled gardens won.

Like many innovations in technology, proprietary innovation in the short term can be a good thing, as long as we don't loose site on the long vision. Distributed and democratized information technology and automation still has a chance.

Cooperation between large corporate interests and individual zealots is driving the next wave of disruption. There is greater realization than ever that both play critical roles in technology disruption. Call it innovators dilemma if you want, but it is also very much about the new information economy that limits access to all but the most extreme views.

Anyway, let me know if you have enough interest for me to expand on this idea. Working with someone like yourself seems critical to realize such a book. 

Some potential topics for essays:
* Linux
* RISC-V and OpenHW
* Personal manufacturing
* Makerspaces
* Personal medical and biotech
* P2P file sharing
* Mastodon
* Freedombox
* AI
* Raspberry Pi
* Open Harware

Regards,
Jason
