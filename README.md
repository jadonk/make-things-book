## Outline

I'll need to spend some time working out the right content, but there should be multiple running threads of interest that
come together in the projects. As I'm thinking this out, I'm realizing these elements can be somewhat written separately,
as if following this outline, but need to be presented in parallel. Multiple readings of the book can help fill in the
details missed, as the primary goal is to make things understandable and interesting, rather than rigorus. Cute boxes that
indicate the theme can be used to carry forward a line of thought, interjecting them where they apply to the projects.

* Forward - my history and story
* Definitions key schools of thought
* History of applied schools of thought mathematics, mechanics, and computer science
* Projects to reproduce revolutions in science and deliver empowerment
* Applications of key concepts of defined schools of thought

## Content
- [ ] Build something with right angles
- [ ] Parallel and series circuits - perhaps building a game to test your understanding
- [ ] Build a robot (right angles, motors)
- [ ] Build a weather station (sensing)
- [ ] Build a musical instrument

## Style
* Jumping around should be OK
* Content should build with all required skills covered in previous chapters
* Friendly character like in the TRS-80 book and on-page note areas with assignments

## Hardware
* BeagleBoard.org BeagleConnect Freedom
* BeagleBoard.org BeagleBone Blue
* Wio Terminal
* Chromebook

### Kits
There should be a collection of kits useful for various book sections
