# Definitions of various schools of thought

## Mathematics

## Science
### Definition
Fundamentally defined by the scientific method of observation, hypothesis, experimentation and communication, science seeks to better
understand causality.

### Lessons
* If it is not possible to device an experiment in an attempt to prove a theory is wrong, then it cannot be proven right. 

## Engineering
### Definition
Apply science and mathematics to create things that help solve human problems, retaining knowledge from previous applications that can be
applied in future attempts to create more things.

### Lessons
* Failure is a critical part of the engineering process.
* While engineering practice is largely limited to working with physicial things, engineering techniques can be applied in many
  disciplines where there are repeatable processes that can be improved.
